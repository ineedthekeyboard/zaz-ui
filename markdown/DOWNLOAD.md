# Installation and Setup

## Install Node

> Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. Use a pre-built installer for your platform @ http://nodejs.org/download

## Install Grunt Client
